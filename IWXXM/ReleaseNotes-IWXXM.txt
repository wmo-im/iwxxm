=========================================
* Restructured and simplified to remove the Observations and Measurements model (O&M) (issue #27)
* Incorporated ICAO Annex 3 / WMO No.49 changes (issue #49):
  + Space Weather Advisory has been added as a new product
  * Tropical Cyclone Advisory (TCA) sequence numbers are now of the form "2004/13" instead of simple numbers
  - TCA observed movement speed can no longer be reported as "moving slowly", per the Annex change

* Added translation failed examples for each product and slightly improved SIGMET Schematron rules to properly support these types
  of messages
