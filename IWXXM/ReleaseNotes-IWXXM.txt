=========================================
Publishing of finalised release

=========================================
3.0.0 Release Candidate 4 - October 2019 
=========================================
* Fixed WMO Code Registry mistakes, enabled schematron rules for checking nilReason codes, and revised examples failing
  validation (issues #155 and #175)
* Revised TAC-to-XML-Guidance.txt to introduce addtional guidances (issue #183)
* Extracted TACs from examples and put them into separate files to reduce the likelihood that real messages will include TAC

* Aligned element naming and ordering across different types of reports including TAF, SIGMET, TCA and VAA (issues #121 and #127)
* Modified the documentation for iwxxm:extremeClockwiseWindDirection and iwxxm:extremeCounterClockwiseWindDirection in METAR and
  SPECI to clarify the relationship with their TAC counterparts (issue #123)
* Modified TropicalCycloneSIGMET and VolcanicAshSIGMET and associated schematron rules to better align with cancellation messages of
  their TAC counterparts (issue #122)
* Fixed issues with regard to the placement of iwxxm:extension (issue #118)
* Modified the documentation for attribute cloudAndVisibilityOK and iwxxm:windgustSpeed in METAR, SPECI and TAF and UML association

  #101)
- Removed iwxxm:geometryLowerLimitOperator and iwxxm:geometryUpperLimitOperator from SIGMET and AIRMET, iwxxm:windLowerLimit,
  iwxxm:windLowerLimitReference, iwxxm:windUpperLimit and iwxxm:windUpperLimitReference from VAA and
  iwxxm:locationLowerLimitOperator from SWA, all of them could be represented by the upper and lower limit descriptions in
  aixm:AirspaceVolume (issue #100)
* Use entries in code list http://codes.wmo.int/common/nil for nilReason descriptions

=========================================
3.0.0 Release Candidate 1 - July 2018
=========================================
* Restructured and simplified to remove the Observations and Measurements model (O&M) (issue #27)
* Incorporated ICAO Annex 3 / WMO No.49 changes (issue #49):
  + Space Weather Advisory has been added as a new product
  * Tropical Cyclone Advisory (TCA) sequence numbers are now of the form "2004/13" instead of simple numbers
  - TCA observed movement speed can no longer be reported as "moving slowly", per the Annex change
* Updated AIR/SIGMET structure to support TC and VA SIGMETs with multiple TCs/volcanoes, and to support the Amd 78 provisions for
  reporting both a TC location along with CB location and movement (#49)
* All METAR/SPECI fields are now nillable in support of cases of observing system failures, such as a broken rain gauge (issue #16)
* All gml:ids are now UUIDs, and this is supported by Schematron rules.  This allows IWXXM message intermediaries to re-assemble
  COLLECT advisories freely without requiring IWXXM message modifications en route (issue #31)
* SIGMET sub-types (VA and TC) elements are now optional to allow cancellations to be reported along with the SIGMET type (issue
  #18)
* All Schematron files were combined into iwxxm.sch, including the WMO Codes Registry validation which were formerly in
  iwxxm-collect-codelists.sch (issue #60)
* Made a number of fields nillable to support the minimum set of required information for failed translation cases (issue #41)
+ Added issue times onto IWXXM messages in support of standalone IWXXM messages (without WMO or Collect headers) (issue #47)
* Snow closure of all runways is now properly indicated, rather than being a snowClosure boolean on a single runway state.  The
  snowClosure boolean was removed, and full aerodrome/all runways snow closure is now indicated with a nilReason of
  "http://codes.wmo.int/bufr4/codeflag/0-20-085/1" with a single runwayState element (issue #48)
* AerodromeObservedClouds was renamed to AerodromeCloud for consistency with other portions of IWXXM (issue #81)
* Added an iwxxm:AirspaceVolumePropertyType to allow for http://... nilReasons to be used with AirspaceVolume references (issue
  #94)
+ METAR/SPECI now have an optional timeIndicator which may be used to indicate FM/TL/AT explicitly (issue #7).
* Enhanced documentation on TAF phenomenonTime to clarify the meaning with timeIndicators of BECOMING (issue #13).

Note: Starting from version 3.0.0, references are made to issues mentioned on GitHub at https://github.com/wmo-im/iwxxm/issues as
      far as possible

=========================================
2.1.1 - November 2017
=========================================
- Removed Schematron rules SIGMET.SEC3, SIGMET.SEC4, AIRMET.AEC9 and AIRMET.AEC10 to fix vertical extend encoding for all allowed
  TAC combinations
* Split Schematron rule TAF.TAF18 to create TAF.TAF19 to allow for missing iwxxm:cloud when CAVOK is reported.  Slight enhancement
  to other Schematron rules for TAF
+ Added the missing quantity information in AIRMET.xsd
* Fixed minor issues in the examples and added bulletin examples with COLLECT
* Added a new schematron file iwxxm-collect-codelist.sch for offline checking of codelist items for pre-implementation testing 

=========================================
2.1.0 - March 2017
=========================================
* Modified AIRMET and SIGMET to correctly handle complex cases where there are multiple OBS/FCST elements and forecast position
  elements.  See http://bit.ly/2lZroAM for more information
  * AIRMET and SIGMET analysis results are now Collection types which may include up to two sets of conditions as allowed by ICAO
    Annex 3 Amendment 77 Table A6-1A Note 27 on "AND" elements.  AIRMET and SIGMET XML elements were renamed to be more consistent.
    The OBS/FCST time indicator was moved to the Collection types, and all other information may be repeated on EvolvingCondition types.
    EvolvingCondition types may now only have a single geometry
    + New elements: SIGMETEvolvingConditionCollection and AIRMETEvolvingConditionCollection
    * Renamed elements: (SIGMET) EvolvingMeteorologicalCondition -> SIGMETEvolvingCondition, AIRMETEvolvingMeteorologicalCondition
      -> AIRMETEvolvingCondition, SIGMET MeteorologicalPosition -> SIGMETPosition, SIGMET MeteorologicalPositionCollection ->
      SIGMETPositionCollection
    * AIRMET and SIGMET analysis elements are now 0..1 and there must now be exactly one geometry element per member element.
      Multiple polygons for an OBS or FCST are represented as multiple member elements in the result
* No significant change (NSC) is now represented on TAFs as a nil reason of
  "http://codes.wmo.int/common/nil/nothingOfOperationalSignificance".  The TAF ForecastChangeIndicator "NO_SIGNIFICANT_CHANGES" has
  been removed and "changeForecast" references are now nillable
* The TAC to XML Guidance document has been updated to be more internally consistent and readable
* Added translation failed examples for each product and slightly improved SIGMET Schematron rules to properly support these types
  of messages
* Per AIXM developer feedback, all AIXM snippets now use the correct "SNAPSHOT" terminology for time slices instead of "BASELINE".
  This required changes to a number of examples
* The METAR LKKV example has been updated to include a wind shear section
* Made relevant elements mentioned in TAC-to-XML-Guidance.txt nillable to allow the inclusion of nilReason as indicated in the text
* Corrected syntax errors in contraints METAR_SPECI.ASW6 and COMMON.ACF2
* Fixed issues with regard to the placement and associated constraints of extension blocks

  other reports
* Implementation of METCE 1.2 structural requirements
- Removed Schematron rule TAF.TAF10 for checking BECMG and FROM groups followed by a PROB group.
* Clarified and fixed a number of examples, including the proper encoding of degree minutes and seconds as decimal degrees and
  incorporation of updates from Annex 3 Amendment 77
