      <documentation>Simplified features from the aeronautical domain, such as aerodrome, runway, unit,
         and airspace.  These features are simplified representations of more complex aeronautical
         features found in AICM/AIXM that are used for storage or transmission.    There are
         two independent issues involved in referencing aeronautical features:  1.  Using AICM/AIXM
         classes directly for these concepts would introduce a dependency on AICM/AIXM, which
         is a package of significant size and complexity  2.  Machine-readable, managed definitions
         for these concepts (such as the location, capabilities, and other information for
         the 'HTKJ' aerodrome) do not exist in a unified and authoritative form.  This information
         is managed independently, and sometimes inconsistently, by many organizations worldwide
         The current version of this package is intended to address the needs for producers
         of meteorological information to be able to distribute the basic characteristics (identification,
         location, time, etc.) of their aeronautical information to consumers.  In many cases
         data producers are the best authority for up-to-date aeronautical information.  Downstream
         consumers may then use this information or ignore it.    These concepts are represented
         in a way that is intended to be largely consistent with AICM/AIXM.
