      <documentation>The 'Observable Property' model enables observed physical properties (also termed
         "Quantities" within the 'International vocabulary of metrology' [http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/documents/jcgm/JCGM_200_2008.pdf])
         to be aggregated into composite properties and for any qualification or constraint
         relating to those observed physical properties to be explicitly described.  A data
         publisher may need to use the Observed Property Model  to explicitly define any qualification
         or constraint applied to the observed property, or, where the observation results
         in the evaluation of multiple properties, to explicitly define each of those individual
         physical properties.  Usage:  The Observable Property Model may be used to specify
         constraint or qualification of a physical quantity (or set of physical quantities)
         within the context of a specific observation or measurement event; e.g. via OM_Observation/parameter
         Attribute (from ISO 19156, type Class "NamedValue"):     - name: http://def.wmo.int/opm/2013/observable-property#property
         [1]     - parameter: instance of Class "AbstractObservableProperty" or concrete subclass
         thereof [2]  Note that Class "OM_Observation" asserts a constraint such that the value
         of the parameter/NamedValue/name Attribute shall not occur more than once within a
         given instance of Class OM_Observation. In situations where multiple physical quantities
         are observed or measured, the value of the associated parameter/NamedValue/value Attribute
         may be specified as an instance of Class "CompositeObservableProperty" thus allowing
         a set of observable properties to be specified.   Also note that, whilst Class "OM_Observation"
         provides Attribute "observedProperty" for specifying the (physical) property observed
         or measured the cardinality of this Attribute is one (e.g. only a single property
         can be referenced). Furthermore, this Attribute is implemented "by reference" (serialised
         as gml:ReferenceType) implying that one cannot define an instance of Class "CompositeObservableProperty"
         in-line within the data. Whilst it is permissible to make a local reference to an
         instance of Class "CompositeObservableProperty" defined elsewhere within the data,
         it is preferable to reference an external definition. The reason for this is that
         the value of Attribute "observedProperty" is used by the OGC Sensor Observation Service
         as a key on which data is indexed; use of internal references are likely to inhibit
         discovery and retrieval of data.   Alternatively, if the constraint or qualification
         of the physical quantity (or set of physical quantities) is consistent within a repeatable
         procedure, it may be defined within the context of that procedure; e.g. via the Process/parameter
         Attribute (from "«Application Schema» METCE", type Class "NamedValue").  Note that
         in the case of Class "Process", there is no constraint on the number of occurences
         of a given parameter name. However, recommended practice indicates the use of an instance
         of Class "CompositeObservableProperty" where a set of observable properties are to
         be specified.  [1] Association Role "property" is specified to have type Class "AbstractObservableProperty"
         [2] Class "AbstractObservableProperty" has concrete sub-classes "ObservableProperty",
         "QualifiedObservableProperty" and "CompositeObservableProperty".
