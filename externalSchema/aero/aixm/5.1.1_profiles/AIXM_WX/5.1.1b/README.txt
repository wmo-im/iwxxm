AIXM_WX is an AIXM Profile for use in the weather community based upon AIXM 5.1.1.
As an AIXM profile, this schema is identical to the original except
that unneeded AIXM content has been removed.  This profile may be used in XML
schemaLocations as an alternative to the full AIXM schema.

The AIXM_WX profile contains those portions of AIXM that are needed to identify and locate
aeronautical regions related to weather reporting.  This profile includes a selected set of
properties from the following AIXM types:

  -AirportHeliport
  -Airspace
  -AirspaceVolume
  -AirspaceLayer (new, included in the AIXM profile for IWXXM 3.0) 
  -Runway
  -RunwayDirection
  -Unit
