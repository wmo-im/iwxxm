====================================
3.0.0RC1 - July 2018
====================================
* Restructured and simplified to remove the Observations and Measurements model (O&M) (issue #27)
* Incorporated ICAO Annex 3 / WMO No. 49 changes (issue #49):
    + Space Weather Advisory has been added as a new product
    * Tropical Cyclone Advisory (TCA) sequence numbers are now of the form "2004/13" instead of simple numbers
    - TCA observed movement speed can no longer be reported as "moving slowly", per the Annex change
* Updated AIR/SIGMET structure to support TC and VA SIGMETs with multiple TCs/volcanoes, and to support the Amd 78
    provisions for reporting both a TC location along with CB location and movement (#49)
* All METAR/SPECI fields are now nillable in support of cases of observing system failures, such as a broken rain
    gauge (issue #16)
* All gml:ids are now UUIDs, and this is supported by Schematron rules.  This allows IWXXM message intermediaries to
    re-assemble COLLECT advisories freely without requiring IWXXM message modifications en route (issue #31)
* SIGMET sub-types (VA and TC) elements are now optional to allow cancellations to be reported along with the SIGMET
    type (issue #18)
* All Schematron files were combined into iwxxm.sch, including the WMO Codes Registry validation which were formerly in
    iwxxm-collect-codelists.sch (issue #60)
* Made a number of fields nillable to support the minimum set of required information for failed translation cases (issue #41)
+ Added issue times onto IWXXM messages in support of standalone IWXXM messages (without WMO or Collect headers) (issue #47)
* Snow closure of all runways is now properly indicated, rather than being a snowClosure boolean on a single runway state.
    The snowClosure boolean was removed, and full aerodrome/all runways snow closure is now indicated with a nilReason of
    "http://codes.wmo.int/bufr4/codeflag/0-20-085/1" with a single runwayState element (issue #48)
* AerodromeObservedClouds was renamed to AerodromeCloud for consistency with other portions of IWXXM (issue #81)
* Added an iwxxm:AirspaceVolumePropertyType to allow for http://... nilReasons to be used with AirspaceVolume references (issue #94)
+ METAR/SPECI now have an optional timeIndicator which may be used to indicate FM/TL/AT explicitly (issue #7)

====================================
2.1.1 - November 2017
====================================
- Removed Schematron rules SIGMET.SEC3, SIGMET.SEC4, AIRMET.AEC9 and AIRMET.AEC10 to fix vertical extend encoding for 
    all allowed TAC combinations
* Split Schematron rule TAF.TAF18 to create TAF.TAF19 to allow for missing iwxxm:cloud when CAVOK is reported.  Slight
    enhancement to other Schematron rules for TAF
+ Added the missing quantity information in AIRMET.xsd
* Fixed minor issues in the examples and added bulletin examples with COLLECT
* Added a new schematron file iwxxm-collect-codelist.sch for offline checking of codelist items for pre-implementation
    testing 

====================================
2.1 - March 2017
====================================
* Modified AIRMET and SIGMET to correctly handle complex cases where there are multiple OBS/FCST elements and forecast
    position elements.  See http://bit.ly/2lZroAM for more information.
    * AIRMET and SIGMET analysis results are now Collection types which may include up to two sets of conditions as
      allowed by ICAO Annex 3 Amendment 77 Table A6-1A Note 27 on "AND" elements.  AIRMET and SIGMET XML elements were
      renamed to be more consistent.  The OBS/FCST time indicator was moved to the Collection types, and all other
      information may be repeated on EvolvingCondition types. EvolvingCondition types may now only have a single geometry
        + New elements: SIGMETEvolvingConditionCollection and AIRMETEvolvingConditionCollection
        * Renamed elements: (SIGMET) EvolvingMeteorologicalCondition -> SIGMETEvolvingCondition,
          AIRMETEvolvingMeteorologicalCondition -> AIRMETEvolvingCondition, SIGMET MeteorologicalPosition -> SIGMETPosition,
          SIGMET MeteorologicalPositionCollection -> SIGMETPositionCollection
        * AIRMET and SIGMET analysis elements are now 0..1 and there must now be exactly one geometry element per member
            element.  Multiple polygons for an OBS or FCST are represented as multiple member elements in the result
* No significant change (NSC) is now represented on TAFs as a nil reason of "http://codes.wmo.int/common/nil/nothingOfOperationalSignificance".
  The TAF ForecastChangeIndicator "NO_SIGNIFICANT_CHANGES" has been removed and "changeForecast" references are now nillable
* The TAC to XML Guidance document has been updated to be more internally consistent and readable
* Added translation failed examples for each product and slightly improved SIGMET Schematron rules to properly support
    these types of messages
* Per AIXM developer feedback, all AIXM snippets now use the correct "SNAPSHOT" terminology for time slices instead of 
    "BASELINE".  This required changes to a number of examples
* The METAR LKKV example has been updated to include a wind shear section
* Made relevant elements mentioned in TAC-to-XML-Guidance.txt nillable to allow the inclusion of nilReason as indicated
    in the text
* Corrected syntax errors in contraints METAR_SPECI.ASW6 and COMMON.ACF2
* Fixed issues with regard to the placement and associated constraints of extension blocks

====================================
2.0 - August 2016
====================================
+ Added two new sets of metadata on all reports:
    * Permissible usage information has been added to indicate operational and test messages
    * Translation information has been added for IWXXM messages that were converted from TAC, such as the translation
        centre and translation time
* Updated from AIXM 5.1 to AIXM 5.1.1, which fixes issues with differing versions of xlink in GML
* In accordance with ICAO Annex 3 / WMO No. 49-2 Amendment 77-A:
    * AIRMETs can now report both wind speed and direction instead of just wind speed
    * SIGMETs can no longer report both a forecast position and expected movement
+ Added extension blocks for non-standard content.  These blocks should be used in accordance with ICAO policy and are
    limited in size
+ Added an XML schema file and a Schematron file to facilitate validation of "bulletinized" IWXXM reports by certain
    validators
* Forecast positions are now allowed on all SIGMETs, not just VA and TC SIGMETs (bug fix)
+ More than one geometry may now be reported for multiple areas of phenomena on VA and TC SIGMETs
* AerodromePresentWeather and AerodromeForecastWeather CodeLists were updated to reflect changes to WMO Code
    Registry locations (now http://codes.wmo.int/49-2/AerodromePresentOrForecastWeather)
+ AIR/SIGMET locations may now indicate approximate locations ('approximateLocation')
+ meanWindSpeedOperator and windGustSpeedOperator were added to AerodromeSurfaceWind to allow the reporting of
    wind speeds above a value
* Changed variableDirection properties to variableWindDirection for consistency between IWXXM products
+ SIGMET cancellation reports may now report when volcanic ash has moved to a new FIR in cases when the prior
    (cancelled) VA SIGMET has moved
* METAR trendForecast can now represent "VV///"
+ Added geometryUppperLimitOperator and geometryLowerLimitOperator to AIR/SIGMETs to indicate phenomenon which have
    tops/bottoms above/below reported heights
+ Added an explicit OBS/FCST indicator to AIRMET and SIGMET (timeIndicator)
* Removed surfaceFrictionUnreliable and estimatedSurfaceFriction, which have been replaced with a single CodeList
    estimatedSurfaceFrictionOrBrakingAction which encapsulates information for both
* cloudAndVisibilityOK is now optional on MeteorologicalAerodromeTrendForecastRecord and constraints were corrected
    with NOSIG and CAVOK cases
+ Added documentations to XML attributes in the schemas
+ Added "Missing Value" to VisualRangeTendency of METAR/SPECI
- Duplicate surfaceWindSpeed and surfaceVisibility were removed from AIRMET
* AIRMETEvolvingCondition speedOfMotion is now optional
* AIRMETEvolvingCondition directionOfMotion is now nillable
* Corrected content type of DistanceWithNilReason and LengthWithNilReason in measure.xsd
* VAA variableWindDirection is now being generated correctly as an XML attribute, similar to other variableWindDirection
    flags in other reports
* Implementation of METCE 1.2 structural requirements
- Removed Schematron rule TAF.TAF10 for checking BECMG and FROM groups followed by a PROB group.
* Clarified and fixed a number of examples, including the proper encoding of degree minutes and seconds as decimal
    degrees and incorporation of updates from Annex 3 Amendment 77
* Simplified Schematron contexts
- Removed redundant Schematron rule SIGMET.SIGMET6 for checking sampled features in SIGMET
- Removed Schematron rule TAF.TAF7 and updated others to allow validation when bulletinized
