FM 205-2025-2 IWXXM-XML ICAO METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION EXCHANGE MODEL
(IWXXM 2025-2)

205-2025-2.1 Scope

205-2025-2.1.1 IWXXM-XML shall be used to represent aviation meteorological information, for international civil aviation, as specified by ICAO Annex 3 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation – _Meteorological Service for International Air Navigation_ (hereinafter referred to as ICAO Annex 3) and ICAO Doc 10157 - _The Procedures for Air Navigation Services - Meteorology_ (hereinafter referred to as ICAO PANS-MET).

205-2025-2.1.2 IWXXM 2025-2 includes provisions for the following types of aviation meteorological information.

{empty}(a) *METAR* is an aerodrome routine meteorological report given at fixed time intervals. The METAR consists of measurements of meteorological parameters of particular importance to aviation safety, navigation and airport operations. The parameters include, but are not limited to, surface wind direction and speed, visibility, runway visual range, when applicable, present weather, cloud amount, cloud types (limited to cumulonimbus and towering cumulus), and height of cloud base, vertical visibility, when applicable, air temperature and dew-point temperature, and airfield pressure setting QNH.

{empty}(b) *SPECI* is an aerodrome special meteorological report given at unscheduled times when SPECI reporting criteria are met. The SPECI consists of the same meteorological parameters as the METAR, and may include the airfield pressure setting QFE, when applicable.

{empty}(c) *TAF* is a terminal aerodrome forecast. The TAF is a meteorological forecast, up to 30 hours in advance, of parameters affecting aviation safety, navigation and route planning. The parameters include forecasts of surface wind direction and speed, visibility, weather phenomena and probability of occurrence, cloud amount, cloud types (limited to cumulonimbus and towering cumulus), and height of cloud base, vertical visibility, maximum and minimum air temperature and their times of occurrence within the forecast period.

{empty}(d) *SIGMET* is a short-fuse message (validity not more than 6 hours, depending on the hazard being described) to alert pilots and air traffic controllers of significant en-route weather hazards to aviation, either occurring or expected to occur, within the specified airspace. Hazards include thunderstorms that are significant in severity and/or areal coverage, tropical cyclone, severe turbulence, severe icing, severe mountain wave phenomena, heavy dust storm and sandstorm, volcanic ash and radioactive release.

{empty}(e) *AIRMET* is a message (validity not more than 6 hours, depending on the hazard being described) to inform pilots and air traffic controllers of en-route weather hazards to aviation, either occurring or expected to occur, within the specified airspace below flight level 100 or below flight level 150 in mountainous terrain. Such hazards include strong surface winds, reduced visibility and the weather phenomena associated with it, thunderstorms, mountain obscuration, low cloud base, moderate icing, moderate turbulence and moderate mountain wave phenomena.

{empty}(f) *Tropical Cyclone Advisory* is a message providing the observed position and characteristics of a convective system of tropical origin along with future positions and motion of the system and its maximum surface wind speeds at fixed time intervals.

{empty}(g) *Volcanic Ash Advisory* is a message informing pilots and air traffic controllers regarding the lateral and vertical extent and forecast movement of volcanic ash clouds in the atmosphere at fixed time intervals following a volcanic eruption.

{empty}(h) *Space Weather Advisory* is a message detailing the extent, severity and duration of space weather phenomena expected to affect high-frequency radio communications, satellite communications, satellite-based navigation and surveillance systems, and/or pose radiation risks to aircraft occupants.

{empty}(i) *World Area Forecast System (WAFS) Significant Weather (SIGWX)* is a set of global forecasts (validity up to 48 hours) at fixed time intervals of significant weather phenomena spanning flight level 100 to 600. Such phenomena shall include, but not be limited to, jet stream, cumulonimbus cloud, turbulence, icing, tropopause height, tropical cyclones, volcanic eruptions, radioactive release and sand/dust storms.

{empty}(j) *Quantitative Volcanic Ash (QVA) Concentration Information* is a message providing information on the concentration of volcanic ash in the atmosphere, including the vertical extent and horizontal distribution of the ash.

{empty}(k) *Volcano Observatory Notice for Aviation (VONA)* is a message issued by a volcano observatory to provide information on volcanic activity, including eruptions, ash plumes, and other related phenomena.

205-2025-2.2 IWXXM versions and amendments

205-2025-2.2.1 After IWXXM 3.0, the IWXXM version is represented by the release year and a number.

205-2025-2.2.2 Each release of IWXXM is composed of individual packages with their own version number following the semantic versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (example TAF 3.0.1) where: 
– A MAJOR (X.y.z) version introduces major conceptual changes. Forward data mapping is not guaranteed. 
– A MINOR (x.Y.x) version introduces new model elements and capabilities guaranteeing forward data mapping for non-deprecated elements or deprecated elements with replacement. Loss of information may happen for elements being no longer required.
– A PATCH (x.y.Z) version is limited to bug fixing. Forward and backward data mapping is guaranteed without loss of information. A PATCH version does not impose changes in a consuming system. A PATCH version may still require data conversion to be done ahead of the data entering the consuming system (done by a mediator service).

205-2025-2.2.3 Each IWXXM version addresses the requirements of amendments to ICAO Annex 3 and/or PANS-MET. Those amendments affect the packages composing IWXXM in different ways, and the resulting new version of the packages shall reflect the level of change required by the amendments following the semantic versioning described in 205-2025-2.2.2.

205-2025-2.2.4 The following table is provided to clarify which version of each package composing IWXXM is compliant with a specific ICAO Annex 3 and PANS-MET amendments.
